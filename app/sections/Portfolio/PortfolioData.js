      "The Vape Superstore project was the most complex e-commerce site I've had a chance to work on. It presented unique challenges and a demanding list of requirements. Apart from an extensive catalogue of products, each with multiple variants, the website required additional custom functionality added on top of Shopify. Such extra features were product bundles, custom search, members points and a modified checkout. The first stages of the project revolved around analysing all the requirements and studying provided UI/UX designs to form an overall vision for the website.",

      'At the beginning I was responsible for setting up the structure/system of the project. This included creating a folder structure for JS and SCSS, establishing base styles, implementing typography/fonts and adding the colour scheme. After settings up a Git repository, I was then assigned to developing the front-end of the site and creating schema in the Shopify editor to enable the client to edit all content. I have developed all the sections on the homepage and created the majority of pages. The most difficult tasks proved to be the header with the mega menu, the account page with custom features as well as the product page, which has grown to be quite complex with all the different product variants, popups and custom bundles.',

      'Overall I am satisfied with the final outcome and my learning experience. Although the project was difficult at times due to the complexity and the amount of custom features, it was a valuable lesson. I was able to learn the ins and outs of Shopify as well as its limits. It is a platform that has been built in a very specific way that imposes a system and can be quite awkward when it needs to be modified in a certain way. In general, I feel my front-end skills have progressed as well. Having been so heavily focused on the website aesthetics and behaviour, I have learned a number of new libraries and understood how to make the UI more attractive, interesting and professional.',

      'Prior to working on Cascades, I was always working in a small team and have been focusing on building out individual front-end sections on WordPress sites. This time, I was mainly working by myself and have been assigned a much larger pool of responsibilities. Apart from building out front-end sections, I was also in charge of organising the content on WordPress and querying all the data with PHP. After having received the designs and gone through the project with a senior developer, I began setting up the site.',

      "At first I was focusing on the back-end and the structure of content in WordPress. As the WordPress editor would be later used by the client, I needed to ensure that the data entry for all content is logical and well organised. To make data entry more powerful and flexible, I've used a popular plugin called Advanced Custom Fields. With all the initial content added, I then outputted and looped through the data with PHP. Styling and making the site responsive was the last task, which I achieved with the usual SCSS workflow. During the whole process I was gathering feedback from my supervisor and in the later stages of the project, the client also got involved with the feedback process.",

Having successfully completed the project as the main developer, this has made me feel more competent and independent as a developer, as well as given me more confidence for new	programming challenges.',

      'For my final year project at university, I decided to pursue a project idea that would be heavily focused on data analysis and user generated data. The reason for this was to allow me to practice JavaScript and dive deeper into data structures concepts. I settled on creating a web app for web traders to analyse trading performance, which worked by entering each trade information and seeing the results in various data visualisations. The web app also consisted of other features, such as a trading journal and a number of helpful calculators/tools. As this was an individual project, I was in charge of all stages of the project, from research and designs to final implementation and user testing.',

      'The initial phase revolved around carrying out an extensive research, both in terms of the potential app aesthetics as well as the technological side, i.e. the most suitable tech stack for the application. The research stage also involved around exploring the target audience, establishing user flows and mapping out the timeline for the project. Branding, sketches, wireframes and high fidelity designs were the following tasks that went through a few iterations as the project progressed. Having had little prior experience with so much data flowing within a codebase, creating a robust data structure for all the data proved to be a tough task. I needed to find a suitable solution to storing all the information that would be easy to query or loop over.',

      'Programming the idea was significantly the most time consuming and difficult operation. To help me organise the project and streamline some aspects, I’ve decided to use numerous tools, including Parcel and Babel for optimisation and compilation, sass for superior styling and D3 for data visualisations. As a starting point, I styled and made the application responsive. Then, I implemented basic functionality such as switching between the pages and logging in. Adding all the charts and graphs using 3D.js was quite complex and fiddly at times, but eventually I managed to replicate my designs. Up to this point the app was working with static data, which now required a layer of logic to connect user input with visualisations. All the JavasScript was organised using the MVC (Model View Controller) pattern. During the remaining few weeks, I focused on user testing, writing the tedious and lengthy dissertation, as well as ironing an abundance of bugs that kept popping out, especially for data computation. Unfortunately I was unable to add a database due to running out of time as the project had to be handed in a working state on time.',

      "Overall, taking into account my programming experience at the time, I am pleased with my efforts and the finished application. Considering the complexity of the app and other synchronously running projects that had to be handed in, it was a fine attempt. Unfortunately my final year project assessors seemed to not have shared my enthusiasm and didn't appreciate my efforts. Despite this, I value this project as I have overcome many obstacles and have noticeably grown as a programmer. If I was to rebuild this project today, I would refine designs, add a database and implement a few major changes, most notably a different tech stack including Routing and of course React and TypeScript to make all the JavaScript logic more manageable.",
