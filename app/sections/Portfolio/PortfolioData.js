After being given UI designs, my tasks revolved around developing the front site of the website. I began with developing a folder structure and setting up base styles such as colors, typography to name a few. The project made use of both scss as well as css files for different sections. Javascript was also split into modules for better workflow.',

I then moved onto other sections on the homepage and eventually started building out other pages. The most difficult page to build was the product page because it consists of a number of popups and drawers, as well as a complex logic for selecting different product variants.',
