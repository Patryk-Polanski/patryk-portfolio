      "The Vape Superstore project was the most complex e-commerce site I've had a chance to work on. It presented unique challenges and a demanding list of requirements. Apart from an extensive catalogue of products, each with multiple variants, the website required additional custom functionality added on top of Shopify. Such extra features were product bundles, custom search, members points and a modified checkout. The first stages of the project revolved around analysing all the requirements and studying provided UI/UX designs to form an overall vision for the website.",

      'At the beginning I was responsible for setting up the structure/system of the project. This included creating a folder structure for JS and SCSS, establishing base styles, implementing typography/fonts and adding the colour scheme. I was then assigned to developing the front-end of the site and creating schema in the Shopify editor to enable the client to edit all content. I have developed all the sections on the homepage and created the majority of pages. The most difficult tasks proved to be the header with the mega menu, the account page with custom features as well as the product page, which has grown to be quite complex with all the different product variants, popups and custom bundles.',

      'Overall I am satisfied with the final outcome and my learning experience. Although the project was difficult at times due to the complexity and the amount of custom features, it was a valuable lesson. I was able to learn the ins and outs of Shopify as well as its limits. It is a platform that has been built in a very specific way that imposes a system and can be quite awkward when it needs to be modified in a certain way. In general, I feel my front-end skills have progressed as well. Having been so heavily focused on the website aesthetics and behaviour, I have learned a number of new libraries and understood how to make the UI more attractive, interesting and professional.',

      'The Cascades project was one of the first Shopify sites that I had a chance to work on. It was also the most complex Shopify store I have ever worked on. After being given UI designs, my tasks revolved around developing the front site of the website. I began with developing a folder structure and setting up base styles such as colors, typography to name a few. The project made use of both scss as well as css files for different sections. Javascript was also split into modules for better workflow.',

I then moved onto other sections on the homepage and eventually started building out other pages. The most difficult page to build was the product page because it consists of a number of popups and drawers, as well as a complex logic for selecting different product variants.',
